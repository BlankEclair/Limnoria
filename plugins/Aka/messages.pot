"    This plugin allows users to define aliases to commands and combinations\n"
"    of commands (via nesting).\n"
"\n"
"    Importing from Alias\n"
"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n"
"\n"
"    Add an aka, Alias, which eases the transitioning to Aka from Alias.\n"
"\n"
"    First we will load Alias and Aka::\n"
"\n"
"        <jamessan> @load Alias\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"        <jamessan> @load Aka\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"\n"
"    Then we import the Alias database to Aka in case it exists and unload\n"
"    Alias::\n"
"\n"
"        <jamessan> @importaliasdatabase\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"        <jamessan> @unload Alias\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"\n"
"    And now we will finally add the Aka ``alias`` itself::\n"
"\n"
"        <jamessan> @aka add \"alias\" \"aka $1 $*\"\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"\n"
"    Now you can use Aka as you used Alias before.\n"
"\n"
"    Trout\n"
"    ^^^^^\n"
"\n"
"    Add an aka, trout, which expects a word as an argument::\n"
"\n"
"        <jamessan> @aka add trout \"reply action slaps $1 with a large trout\"\n"
"        <bot> jamessan: The operation succeeded.\n"
"        <jamessan> @trout me\n"
"        * bot slaps me with a large trout\n"
"\n"
"    This ``trout`` aka requires the plugin ``Reply`` to be loaded since it\n"
"    provides the ``action`` command.\n"
"\n"
"    LastFM\n"
"    ^^^^^^\n"
"\n"
"    Add an aka, ``lastfm``, which expects a last.fm username and replies with\n"
"    their most recently played item::\n"
"\n"
"        @aka add lastfm \"rss [format concat http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/ [format concat [web urlquote $1] /recenttracks.rss]]\"\n"
"\n"
"    This ``lastfm`` aka requires the following plugins to be loaded: ``RSS``,\n"
"    ``Format`` and ``Web``.\n"
"\n"
"    ``RSS`` provides ``rss``, ``Format`` provides ``concat`` and ``Web`` provides\n"
"    ``urlquote``.\n"
"\n"
"    Note that if the nested commands being aliased hadn't been quoted, then\n"
"    those commands would have been run immediately, and ``@lastfm`` would always\n"
"    reply with the same information, the result of those commands.\n"
"    "
